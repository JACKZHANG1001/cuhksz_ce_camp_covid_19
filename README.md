# cuhksz_ce_camp_covid_19

## Goals
- To analyze the COVID-19 data in Hubei, China and get a mathematical epidemic model for the virus.
- To explore that how different policies can affect the model.
- To use the model created above to predict the breakpoint.
- To conclude some good advice for the policy maker to flatten the curve.

## Tool
- Matlab

## Methods
- Using the basic SEIR model and modifying it with actual factors (policies, medical ability...).
- Using the previous data to train a model which satisfies the previous data.
- Caculating the error between the model trained by the previous and the real new data.
- Using Matlab to solve the diffierential equations and graphing.
- Maybe using Matlab to use the knowledge machine learning to get some good enough parameters.
  
## Thoughts
- Based on the paper published by Zhong Nanshan's team, creating a model.
